# vue-select-next

This is completely based on [vue-select](https://github.com/sagalbot/vue-select). Ported to Vue 3. All credits go to [sagalbot](https://github.com/sagalbot)

All I have done is port it for vue 3

You can check docs for vue-select at https://vue-select.org/

## Basic usage

```js
import VSelect from 'vue-select-next';
import 'vue-select-next/css';
```

```html
<VSelect :options="['foo', 'bar']" />
```
